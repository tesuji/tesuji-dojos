  #     Somebody that I used to know told me yesterday that "Friends are like NFTs."
  #     I'm no longer friends with them, but the "blockchain" or something still
  #     thinks they're friends with me! Could you please fix that?

      I heard C was insecure so I wrote my flag redactor program in C++.
      Note: There are multiple optimized implementations of `memmove` and
      one is selected at runtime based on available CPU features, meaning that
      any solution that uses the `memmove` GOT entry could fail on remote.
      The challenge is solvable without `memmove`.

      My friend keeps writing super insecure C programs but I'm too lazy
      to fix his code. I'm sure it'll be fine as long as I use enough
      exploit mitigations, right?
